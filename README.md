## Expert Advisor Description

The DYJ AtrTrendReversal Expert Advisor is designed to forecast market volatility and make trading decisions based on the Average True Range (ATR) trend line. The ATR indicator is calculated with a period of 14 and is used to determine potential trend reversals.

The Expert Advisor calculates the ATR trend line by rounding the ATR value to the number of decimal places of the symbol. The high value of the ATR trend line is set to the rounded ATR value, while the low value is set to half of the high value.

The Expert Advisor then checks for trend reversals based on the ATR trend line. If the high value of the ATR trend line is more than 1.5 times the low value, it indicates a potential trend change, and appropriate action can be taken. Otherwise, if the ATR trend line indicates no significant change, the Expert Advisor continues with the current trend.
